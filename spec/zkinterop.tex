		\section{Introduction}
		Implementing zero-knowledge proof constructions is not a trivial task and comes with diverse matters, as is extensively explained in the \href{https://zkproof.org/proceedings-snapshots/zkproof-implementation-20180801.pdf}{Implementation Track proceeding} of the first workshop. One of the requirements is to create a compiler of statements to be proven into a native low-level representation of the proving system.
		
		There are several trade-offs one can consider when designing general-purpose (front-end) compilers, lending to distinct frameworks, APIs, generality, etc. Today, existing compilers are implemented to work best with their corresponding (back-end) proving system (somemetimes more than one). For a comprehensive list of front-ends and back-ends, you can go to \href{https://zkp.science}{zkp.science}. 
		
		These libraries are usually built end-to-end: they take in some constraint system that defines the statement of the proving computation. In turn, there exist some tools to facilitate writing such constraint systems, which usually means compiling a program into R1CS, such as ZoKrates, gadget-lib or sapling-crypto.
		
		Generally, the compilers can output intermediary files and configurations, yet are used for a specific back-end. In practice this means there is no portability between proving systems and compilers. We aim to solve this issue by creating a community standard proposal for the ZKProof effort around constraint system formatting. We build upon the work done at the first ZKProof workshop, see the file format suggested and the further topics laid out. 
		
		In essence, we design and implement a standard rank-1 constraint system (R1CS) interface between front-ends and back-ends. Our design encompasses programmable instance and witness reductions, while capturing the underlying semantics, such as the scalar field or the depth of the merkle tree, among others.
		
		\paragraph{Background.} Zero-knowledge allow a prover to convince a verifier of the validity of some statement. In practice, these statements can be large and difficult to build, which is why developers usually build smaller components that are re-usable with different statements; these components are sometimes called ``gadgets". One can compose the different 
		
		
		\paragraph{Terminology}
		The following list is in accordance to the terminology established in the 1st ZKProof Workshop.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Parameter
			\item Argument
			\item Circuit
			\item Component (gadget)
			\item Script
			\item Witness
			\item Shared Inputs / Outputs
			\item Local Inputs / Outputs
			
		\end{itemize}
		
		
		\paragraph{Challenges and limitations}
		
		The main challenges of designing the interface come from the underlying semantics of the systems used. When compiling a given program into a constraint system, the different components have context to them
		
		- semantics do not encompass circuit structure
			- boolean circuits
			- repetitions in computation
		- gadget composability
		- 
		
		\paragraph{Scope.} We aim for the standard interface to be as generic as possible, including non-R1CS-based proving systems. However, the current proposal is more limited, mainly due to time constraints.
		
		We propose to standardize the following:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A file format for rank-1 constraint systems
			\item A messaging interface  for generic communication between frameworks
			\item A C API for interoperability
		\end{itemize}
		
		This proposal is not aiming to standardize a language or framework for generating constraint systems, nor the way that components of the proving statement should be written.  
		
		
		\paragraph{Motivation and Previous work.} There is currently no other tool for combining zero knowledge front-ends to any back-end without creating a specific pair-wise interface. If you are a developer who has a favorite compiler to write constraints, with zkInterface, you can also chose your favorite implementation of any proving system. zkInterface can be seen as a common way to communicate between different zero-knowledge systems, as exemplified below.

		- what else??
