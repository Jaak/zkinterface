\paragraph{Interface Definition.}

	The interface is defined as a FlatBuffers schema that describes 
	the serialization of messages that the caller and callee can exchange.

	The FlatBuffers system includes a simple interface definition language,
	support for all common programming languages,
	a clear evolution path for future extensions of the standard,
	and the possibility of very efficient implementations.
